Flexbox Playground using HTML &amp; CSS

1. Create a flex container and add several flex items.
2. Use flex-direction to arrange the items horizontally or vertically.
3. Experiment with justify-content and align-items to align the items as needed.
4. Use flex-wrap to allow the items to wrap onto the next line when the container size is reduced.
